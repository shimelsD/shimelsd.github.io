      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''

           I'm a data-driven health crusader with a code-savvy edge, a public health researcher passionate about turning complex datasets into life-saving insights. By day, I lecture future health informatics leaders at Wollo University. By night (and often weekends!), I dive deep into R, Python, Keras, and SHAP, decoding Ethiopiaâ€™s health patterns from EDHS surveys like a digital epidemiologist.

           Iâ€™ve published in top-tier journals, developed a Java-based clinic information system, forecasted neonatal mortality, and mastered time series smoothing techniques. I also mentor rising researchers and prepare myself for the next chapter: a PhD in data science at a world-class institution. What drives me is the intersection of AI, health equity, and explainability â€” making sure machine learning models donâ€™t just predict, but empower decision-makers in maternal and child health, chronic disease, and beyond. If thereâ€™s a pattern in public health, Iâ€™ll find it, map it, and model it â€” always with real-world impact in mind.
    
           ðŸ”¥ Health equity + machine learning + code = me.
